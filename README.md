# Deploy Application from Jenkins Pipeline to EC2 Instance (using Docker)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a web application to an AWS EC2 instance directly from a Jenkins pipeline using Docker. The process automates Continuous Deployment (CD) by extending a CI pipeline with a deployment stage.

---

## Technologies: **AWS, Jenkins, Docker, Linux, Git, Java, Maven, Docker Hub**

---

## Project Description
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Prepare the AWS EC2 Instance for Deployment**: Install Docker on the instance.
2. **Set Up Jenkins Credentials for SSH Access**: Create SSH key credentials for the EC2 server.
3. **Extend CI Pipeline with Deployment Step**:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance from Jenkins via SSH.
   - Deploy the Docker image built in the Jenkins CI pipeline.
4. **Configure Security Group for EC2**: Open necessary ports to access the web application.

---

## Steps to Prepare AWS EC2 Instance for Deployment

### Install Docker
1. Log in to your EC2 instance via SSH.
2. Install Docker using the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install docker -y
   sudo service docker start
   sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
   ```
3. Verify the Docker installation:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

---

## Steps to Create SSH Key Credentials in Jenkins
1. Install the **SSH Agent** plugin:
   - Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
   - Search for and install the "SSH Agent" plugin.
2. Add SSH Credentials:
   - Go to **Dashboard** > Your Project > **Credentials**.
   - Click on **Global credentials (unrestricted)** > **Add Credentials**.
   - Select **SSH Username with private key**.
   - Provide:
     - **ID**: `ec2-server-key`
     - **Username**: `ec2-user`
     - **Private Key**: Paste the private key contents.
   - Save the credentials.
3. Update EC2 Security Group:
   - Add the Jenkins server IP to the EC2 instance's inbound rules for port `22` (SSH).

## Steps to Extend CI Pipeline with Deployment Stage

### Add Deployment Stage to Jenkinsfile
 Edit the `Jenkinsfile` in the project repository to include a deployment stage:
   ```groovy
      stage("deploy") {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'deploying docker image to EC2...'
                    def dockerCmd = "docker run -p 8080:8080 -d ${IMAGE_NAME}"
                    sshagent(['aws-ec2-server-key']) {
                        sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ec2-user@34.229.224.203 ${dockerCmd}"
                    }
                }
            }               
        }
   ```

### Log In to Docker Hub on EC2 instance
1. SSH into the EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2-server-key.pem ec2-user@34.229.224.203
   ```

2. Log in to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

---

## Configure Security Group for Web Application Access
1. Open the EC2 instance's security group settings in the AWS console.
2. Add an inbound rule to allow access to port `8080`:
   - **Type**: Custom TCP
   - **Port Range**: 8080
   - **Source**: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

---

## Deploy and Access the Web Application
1. Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to build and deploy the application.
2. Check whether the container is running on the target instance:
   ```bash
   docker ps 
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
   b91cb1618412   irschad/java-app:4.0   "java -jar java-maveâ€¦"   9 seconds ago   Up 8 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp   confident_li
   ```
   
3. Access the deployed application in a browser using the URL:
   ```
   http://34.229.224.203:8080
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure the Jenkins server can connect to the target EC2 instance via SSH.
- Update the security groups responsibly to prevent exposing unnecessary ports.
